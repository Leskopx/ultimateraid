# ultimateraid - discord bot  (first repo)
(JS) Ultimateraid is the ultimate raid bot for discord ! (Educational purpose)

How to use:
  
  Run the install.bat file,
  When it's finished, open the data.json file, and replace everything wtih what you want,
  Then, just run the run.bat file, and if everything is ok, the bot should start correctly,
  If you have any errors, you can contact me by discord: (0x38) Space#1234 (If my tag is not working, get any channel and send <@749955749462933554> , it will ping me and you will be able to friend request me.
  
Warning:

  Soemtimes, the console can get spammed, when the bot is trying to send a message in a channel that doesn't exists anymore, this will be patched soon, but if it does that, you can juste close and run again the run.bat, it'll restart the bot.
  
If the bot appears offline, it's ok, he is still online if you have your console opened.

Last thing if you're scared if the .bat files, you're free to open them with a text editor, you will see there is nothing harmful.
